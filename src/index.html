        <h3>9/1/2021</h3>
        <p class="justify-text"><b>overview</b> PI Andrew White at University of Rochester Chemical
            Engineering is looking
            for a
            postdoctoral researcher to contribute to a 5-year NIH-funded project on "Learning to learn in
            structural biology with deep neural networks."</p>
        <p class="justify-text"><b>what you'll do</b> We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher who
            is an expert in
            molecular simulation, deep learning in chemistry, or computational structural biology. Under
            mentorship, you will develop and apply deep learning methods to molecular simulation and
            modeling of proteins and protein-protein interactions. Expertise in deep learning is not
            required, though is a strength. This is a multi-year project with a long-term goal towards
            advancing ML and AI methods for deep learning and meta-learning in structural biology. These
            methods reduce the amount of data necessary to apply supervised learning to applications where
            there are only tens to hundreds of data points. Examples include developing peptide drugs,
            antibody design, multifunctional biomaterials, and resolving intrinsically disordered protein
            conformations. As a postdoctoral researcher, you will mentor graduate students, lead independent
            projects, and collaborate in research planning. You can find examples of our recent work on our
            publications page. You will work with an interdisciplinary team with backgrounds in computer
            science,
            molecular simulation, and biochemistry. </p>
        <p class="justify-text"><b>requirements</b> Candidates should have a PhD degree in chemical
            engineering, chemistry, physics, computer science or related area. You should have multiple
            peer-reviewed publications in addition to a PhD. You should have demonstrated expertise in
            statistical mechanics. Expertise in biochemistry and/or deep learning is a
            strength. Candidate should have experience in scientific software best-practices, including
            version control, testing, and software collaboration. A GitHub account or similar project
            portfolio is required. </p>
        <p class="justify-text"><b>details</b> This position is open immediately. Starting date is negotiable, and
            candidates will be evaluated
            until the position is filled. The initial appointment will be 1 year and is renewable. Salary is
            set by NIH guidelines on postdoctoral research salary. All nationalities are welcome to apply
            and will be considered. Minority and women candidates are especially encouraged to apply. To
            apply, please send an email to <a href="mailto:andrew.white@rochester.edu">Andrew White</a> with
            the subject "Postdoc Search 2021" and describe your interest in the position and attach (1)
            curriculum vitae, (2) an example
            of a recent publication authored by you and (3) an example of a scientific software, preferably
            your GitHub username.</p>
